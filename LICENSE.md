# RSDKv4 DECOMPILATION & Scarlet Engine SOURCE CODE LICENSE

The code in this repository is a decompilation of RSDK (Retro-Engine, also known as Retro Software Development Kit) version 4, edited to have more capabilities than the original decompilation of RSDKv4.
There is original code in this repo, but most of the code is to be functionally the same as the official RSDKv4 and some extra functionality added by Scarlet Engine.

This code is provided as-is, that is to say, without liability or warranty. 
Original authors of RSDK, authors of the decompilation and authors of Scarlet Engine are not held responsible for any damages or other claims said.

You may copy, modify, contribute, and distribute, for public or private use, **as long as the following are followed:**
- All pre-built executables provided TO ANYONE *PRIVATE OR OTHERWISE* **must be built with DLC disabled by __default.__**
  - A define, `RSDK_AUTOBUILD`, and a CMake flag, `RETRO_DISABLE_PLUS`, are already provided for you to force DLC off.
  - Creating a configuration setting *is allowed,* so long as it is set to off by default.
    - *No such configuration will be pushed to the master repository.*
  - This is to ensure an extra layer of legal protection for Sonic Origins Plus and other games that involve legal protection
- You may not use neither the decompilation or/and Scarlet Engine for commercial (any sort of profit) use.
- You must clearly specify that the decompilation, original & Scarlet Engine's new code are not yours: the developers of the three must be credited.
- You may not distribute assets used to run the game not directly provided by the repository (other than unique, modded assets).
- This license must be in all modified copies of source code, and all forks must follow this license (this edited version of the license though, must only be in Scarlet Engine forks. The original license made by Rubberduckycooly (aka RDC/Ducky) and Chuli (aka RMGRich/stxtic) must only stay in RSDKv4 decompilation forks).

Original RSDK author: Christian "Taxman" Whitehead

Decompilation authors: Rubberduckycooly (aka RDC/Ducky) and Chuli (aka RMGRich/stxtic)
